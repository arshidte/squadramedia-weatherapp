# React + TypeScript + Vite


Hi,


The weather app has developed based on the guidelines provided.
After cloning, run `npm install`.
To run the application `npm run dev`.


Current location will be fetched while loading the page. Based on that, current weather of the location can be seen.

The locations mentioned in the task are added. The date picker of from and to dates are added. The 30 day limit in date range selection is managed.

As I found the API for giving date range is paid, I couldn't show that result. But, every code to show that has been written.

So, if the API is changed, that can also be seen.


Thank you.
